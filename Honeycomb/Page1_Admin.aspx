            <p><span class="texthighlight">▹</span> Weston Estate wants the world to know that they are definitively “ya aunty’s favorite boy band.” Named in jest for an affluent neighborhood adjacent to their hometown of Cary, North Carolina, the lo-fi, alt band is an alluring anomaly. Members Srikar Nanduri (guitar), Manas Panchavati (vocals), Tanmay Joshi (vocals), Abhi Manhass (production, bass), and Marco Luka (vocals) are five best friends whose descriptions of each other range from “epicurean dumbass,” “nicest guy you’ll ever meet,” to “a Spongebob character.” All of Indian descent with the exception of Marco who is first generation Cuban-American, they’ve tapped into their cultural influences, eclectic range of personalities and individual tastes to carve out a new space entirely of their own.</p>

                <span class="texthighlight">▹</span> ericdoa is from what he describes as a “small a** farm town” in Connecticut, certainly not known for its artistic output or community. Without many like-minded kids at school, he spent most of his time on the internet growing up and met nearly all of his closest friends and collaborators online via platforms like Discord and Twitter.
                <br />
                <br />
                Eric grew up around a music-oriented family and was exposed to “raw pop artists” like Rick James, Earth Wind & Fire, and Teena Marie at a young age. When he started making music around 14 years old, these influences meshed with the music he heard online, and Eric taught himself to record and produce his own material.

                <span class="texthighlight">▹</span> Michael Davie is 21 and hailes from Vermont. Dynamic vocal range and layered harmonies, a musical ‘cinematic’ style, and a creative production. His personality may be nervous in front of the camera, but you can see the enthusiasm underneath. greek loves what he’s doing and it shows.

                <br />
                His first song to hook me was safety. Produced by Davie and Max Vossberg, safety is a slow song that conveys the pain of lonely nights, looking for someone special and finding that safe harbour. Horns swell at the end of the chorus, bringing the listener down to gentler acoustics, until the drums lead us to a electric finale.
